# This project contains the code of group 15 for CSU33D03 (2023-24)

## It is a basic implementation of a basic consensus protocol, implemented to be capable of the following tasks:

- **Discover** - discover other nodes on the network that you can potentially interact and collaborate with.
- **Negotiate** - negotiate with each of these nodes to discover their offered services, capabilities and constraints, and to advise them of your offered services, capabilies and constraints.
- **Agreement** -  shared agreement and consensus on the collaborative activity, service or task to be provided.
- **Action** - an action that demonstrates the meaningful and effective use of the agreed consensus which you have just achieved.

### Bonus
Bonus acvity: Build into your consensus mechanism 
1. A capability to detect malicious behaviour intended to meaningfully compromise or adversely impact the consensus approach, and 
2. Effective mechanisms to anticipate and mitigate such approaches.
